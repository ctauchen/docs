# Calico Enterprise 3.20 release notes

:::info early preview release

Calico Enterprise 3.19 can be used for previewing and testing purposes only.
It is not supported for use in production.

:::

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Support for OpenShift hosted control planes

You can now install Calico Enterprise on OpenShift clusters that use hosted control planes.

For more information, see [Installing Calico Enterprise on an OpenShift HCP cluster](../getting-started/install-on-clusters/openshift/hostedcontrolplanes.mdx)

### Packet capture and compliance reports are disabled by default

We've changed the default behavior for packet capturing and compliance reporting.
These features are now disabled by default.
You can enable either feature in Manager UI, by running a kubectl command, or by adding them to your `values.yaml` file.

:::note Update note
If you're updating to Calico Enterprise 3.20 and want to continue using the packet capture or compliance reporting features, you must re-enable them during or after the update.

## Known issues

* Flow logs for the Windows workloads currently do not display entries with a Deny action.
* Before upgrading a {{prodname}} cluster on MKE v3.6 to the latest {{prodname}} version: 1) upgrade MKE from 3.6 to 3.7, then 2) upgrade {{prodname}}.
* L7 logs with source name `pvt` is not visible in Service Graph.
* *Multi-cluster management users only*. If the `manager-tls` and `internal-manager-tls` secrets have overlapping DNS names, components such as `es-calico-kube-controllers` will log certificate errors. If you have previously installed a version older than v3.13.0 and never changed your manager-tls secret from the tigera-operator namespace, you must delete both of these secrets. This applies to you if the following command prints a certificate: `$ kubectl get secret manager-tls -n tigera-operator -o "jsonpath={.data['cert']}"`.
* Upgrading to {{prodname}} 3.18.0 on Rancher/RKE from {{prodname}} 3.13.0 currently requires manually terminating the calico-node container for an upgrade to proceed.
* Calico panics if kube-proxy or other components are using native `nftables` rules instead of the `iptables-nft` compatibility shim. Until Calico supports native nftables mode, we recommend that you continue to use the iptables-nft compatibility layer for all components. (The compatibility layer was the only option before Kubernetes v1.29 added alpha-level `nftables` support.) Do not run Calico in "legacy" iptables mode on a system that is also using `nftables`. Although this combination does not panic or fail (at least on kernels that support both), the interaction between `iptables` "legacy" mode and `nftables` is confusing: both `iptables` and `nftables` rules can be executed on the same packet, leading to policy verdicts being "overturned".
* Linseed deployment needs to be manually restarted after an upgrade. Without a restart, Linseed can't ingest data because it can't authenticate with Elastic.
