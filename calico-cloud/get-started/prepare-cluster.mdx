# Prepare your cluster for Calico Cloud

Intro material

## Verify cluster is not managed by a Kubernetes reconciler

{{prodname}} cannot be installed on clusters that are managed by any kind of Kubernetes reconciler (for example, Addon-manager). To verify, look for an annotation called `addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode` on either of the following resources. (The resources may not exist).

- `tigera-operator` deployment in the `tigera-operator` namespace (Installation on AKS may still work if the mode is Reconcile, see [AKS](aks.mdx#verify-addonmanager-is-compatible) for an additional check.)
- `calico-node` daemonset in the `kube-system` namespace

If the following command finds addonmanager on either of the resources, then Addon-manager is being used. Find a different cluster to use.

```bash
kubectl get <type> -n <namespace> <resource-name> -o yaml | grep ' addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode:'
```

## Prepare your infrastructure to connect to Calico Cloud

Pods running in your Kubernetes cluster must allow outbound traffic to the following endpoints:

- `https://installer.calicocloud.io:443/*`
- `https://www.calicocloud.io:443/api/*`
- `https://client-auth.calicocloud.io:443/*`
- TCP to `<management-cluster>.calicocloud.io:9000`

For each node, Docker must be able to pull images from the following endpoints:

* `quay.io`
* `cdn01.quay.io`
* `cdn02.quay.io`
* `us-docker.pkg.dev`
