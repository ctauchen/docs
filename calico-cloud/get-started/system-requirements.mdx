# System requirements

Before you connect your cluster to Calico Cloud, make sure your cluster meets the system requirements.
Your cluster must already have a CNI installed before you can connect to Calico Cloud.

## Kubernetes distributions and CNIs

Calico Cloud works with Kubernetes on self-provisioned infrastructure and on managed Kubernetes distributions.
To use Calico Cloud for both networking and network policy, your cluster must have Calico Open Source installed before you connect to Calico Cloud.
For most managed distributions, you can use the provider's CNI for networking and use Calico Cloud for network policy.

| Distribution | CNI |
| --- | --- |
| Kubernetes on self-provisioned infrastructure | - Calico Open Source 3.26 and 3.27 |
| Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service | - Calico Open Source 3.26 and 3.27<br/> - Amazon VPC CNI |
| Azure Kubernetes Service | - Calico Open Source 3.26 and 3.27<br/> - Azure CNI |
| Google Kubernetes Engine | - Calico Open Source 3.26 and 3.27<br/> - GKE CNI |
| Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2  v2.6.5 or later | - Calico Open Source 3.26 and 3.27 |
