# Creating Jira issues for vulnerable images

After your images have been found, the Manager UI can help facilitate remediation of your vulnerable through a Jira integration.

This integration allows you to create Jira Issues directly from the Scan Results page and attaches information about the
vulnerable package found.

# Configuring the Jira Integration

1. In the top right user icon in the Manager UI, click **Settings**.
1. On the Settings page, click **Jira** tab.
1. Fill in the Username, Url, and API Token fields for the Jira account you want to integrate with.

Once done, you can select the Jira Project to create Image Assurance Scan Result issues in.

# Using the Jira Integration

## Creating a new Jira issue for a Scan Result
