# Calico Open Source 3.28 release notes

Learn about the new features, bug fixes, and other updates in this release of {{prodname}}.

## New features and enhancements

### Configure multiple IP pools during installation

You can now configure multiple IP pools when you install Calico on your clusters.
Specifying multiple IP pools during installation is important for clusters where IP address assignment is tied to the topology of the cluster.
This can be helpful, for example, when IP pools are assigned to particular nodes, racks, or availability zones in order to satisfy internal policy or firewalling restrictions.

For more information, see [Create multiple IP pools](../networking/ipam/ippools.mdx).

### Delay pod Ready status until after network policies are rendered

This update lets you prevent new pods from moving to a ready status until after their network policies have finished rendering.
In some high-churn environments, pods may be deployed and marked as ready before network policies have been rendered, causing problems when traffic to those pods is denied.
The new `policy_setup_timeout_seconds` configuration option allows you build in a delay to give those polices time to finish processing.

You may find this option useful if you're running traditional applications that assume resiliency in the architecture.

For more information, see [Enabling policy setup timeout](../reference/configure-cni-plugins.mdx#enabling-policy-setup-timeout).

### IPv6 support for eBPF mode is generally available

Calico Open Source 3.28 introduces full support for IPv6 for clusters using the eBPF data plane.

For more information, see [Enable the eBPF dataplane](../operations/ebpf/enabling-ebpf.mdx) and [Configure dual stack or IPv6 only](../networking/ipam/ippools.mdx).

### Enhancements

* We made it easier to migrate your cluster from iptables to eBPF data plan modes.
Previously, having a mix of nodes in iptables and eBPF modes could cause a breakdown in cluster networking.
Now, the operator makes the transition with minimal disruption.
* We improved how Felix calculates rules in situations where there are high numbers (up to 200) of shared policies per endpoint.
Depending on the number of shared policies, this can reduce the number of rules per pod by several hundred.
These improvements apply only when Calico is running in iptables mode.
